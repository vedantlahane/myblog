## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### New Service Structure (`/frontend/src/lib/services/`)
```
services/
├── index.ts              # Main export and BlogApiClient class
├── base.ts              # BaseHttpClient with shared functionality  
├── auth.service.ts      # Authentication operations
├── user.service.ts      # User profile and social features
├── post.service.ts      # Post CRUD and interactions
├── comment.service.ts   # Comment management
├── search.service.ts    # Search functionality
└── README.md           # Comprehensive documentation
```

### Key Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service handles specific domain
- **Code Reusability**: Shared base class reduces duplication
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- **Maintainability**: Organized structure for easier updates
- **Backward Compatibility**: Original API client still works

## 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

### Backend Route Additions
- **Tag Routes**: Added `getTagBySlug` endpoint (`/api/tags/slug/:slug`)
- **Controller Methods**: Implemented missing tag controller functionality

### Frontend API Client Updates
- **Notification Methods**: Fixed endpoint URLs (`/api/notifications/mark-all-read`)
- **Comment Features**: Added `getCommentsByPost`, `getCommentReplies`  
- **User Social**: Added `savePost`, `unsavePost`, `getSavedPosts`
- **Tag Operations**: Added `getPopularTags`, `getPostsByTag`
- **Search Enhancement**: Added `globalSearch`, `getSearchSuggestions`

### Type System Updates
- **Interface Alignment**: All TypeScript interfaces match backend models
- **Method Signatures**: Corrected parameter types and return types
- **Error Handling**: Improved error response typing
